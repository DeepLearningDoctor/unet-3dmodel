This repository contains a 3D model of a UNET (Convolutional Neural Network architecture) designed to visualize its structure in three dimensions within Microsoft PowerPoint presentations.


About UNET
UNET is a convolutional neural network architecture widely used for biomedical image segmentation tasks. It was introduced by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox in their paper titled "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation" in 2015. UNET is particularly well-suited for semantic segmentation tasks where the goal is to assign a class label to each pixel in an input image.

The architecture of UNET consists of an encoding path (contracting path) and a decoding path (expansive path). The encoding path captures context information from the input image through a series of convolutional and pooling layers, while the decoding path generates a segmentation map by upsampling and concatenating features from the encoding path through skip connections.

In this particular model, we have implemented a UNET architecture with the following characteristics:

Four skip connections
One bottleneck layer

To incorporate the 3D UNET model into your PowerPoint presentation, follow these steps:

Download the .3mf File: Download the provided file containing the 3D UNET model from the repository.

Open PowerPoint: Launch Microsoft PowerPoint and open the presentation where you want to insert the 3D model.

Insert the 3D Model: Navigate to the slide where you want to add the 3D UNET model. Then, go to the "Insert" tab and select "3D Models" from the "Illustrations" group. Choose "From File" and select the downloaded .glb file.

Adjust the Model: Resize and position the 3D model according to your preferences. You can also adjust its orientation and lighting using PowerPoint's 3D model manipulation tools.

Present Your Slide: When you present your PowerPoint slide, the 3D UNET model will be displayed, allowing your audience to visualize the architecture of the UNET network in three dimensions.
